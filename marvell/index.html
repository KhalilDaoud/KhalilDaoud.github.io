	<h3>Biography</h3>
	</blockquote>

	<p class="flow-text" style="text-indent:50px;">
  Marvell was born in Winestead-in-Holderness on March 31, 1621, and was the son of a Church of England clergyman who was also named Andrew Marvell.
  At the age of thirteen, Marvell attended Trinity College, Cambridge and received his BA degree. Marvell wrote his first poems, which were written in Latin 
  Greek when he was still at Cambridge. He wrote about the plague the birth of King Charles I child. Later in life Marvell's worked focused more on political 
  matters, and public issues, he also wrote the poem which he is arguably most famous for; "To His Coy Mistress". Marvell died suddenly in 1678, however his death 
  is a bit of a controversy as he was reported as having very good health before his death, leading some to think that he may had been poisoned by political or clerical rivals.

  "To His Coy Mistress" is disputably Marvell's most recognized and famous poem, and is an example of Carpe Diem poetry. In this poem marvel is addressing a woman (presumably someone he is pursuing romantically) and is
  telling her that if they had all the time in the world, than he would not mind sitting and admiring all of her minor intricacies and details for thousands of years at a time, as that is what she deserves, but because 
  they only have so much time on earth, they should enjoy each other while they can and while they are still youthful. This is an example of the "make the most of the time you have" and "get out and do it" themes that 
  make a poem a Carpe Diem poem. It is interesting to note that the poem is split and structured into three paragraphs each representing "if", "however", and "therefore" respectively as Marvell makes his argument.
